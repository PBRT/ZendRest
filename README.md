Zend Rest Server
================

My first Rest server built on Zend Framework 2, inspired by [Big sticky Notes projects] (https://github.com/bigemployee/Big-Sticky-Notes). Still in developement. 

Rest server built in order to communicate with [iWallet application] (https://github.com/PBRT/iWallet)
